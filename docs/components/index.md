Components in this section have been created by designers and developers at dxw.

To use these components you can either:

- copy the HTML code
- copy the Nunjucks code (if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)) 

If a similar component is in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/), you should use that component instead. The MOJ component will be [archived](archived-components).
